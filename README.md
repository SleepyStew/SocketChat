# Socket Chat
Made as a fun project and as a challenge to implement my own low level encryption system.

# Features
- Authentication (Doesn't store passwords securely, proof of concept)
- Custom keypair exchange and encryption system
- Keeps track of who is logged in (prevents same user from logging in twice), has join and leave system messages
